### Storytelling Data Visualization on Exchange Rates

there are two types of data visualization:
 * Exploratory data visualization: we create graphs for ourselves to better understand and explore data.
 * Explanatory data visualization: we create graphs for others to inform, make a point, or tell a story.

Throughout the Project, we focused on explanatory data visualization and learned the following:

* How to use information design principles (familiarity and maximizing the data-ink ratio) to create better graphs for an audience.
* About the elements of a story and how to create storytelling data visualizations using Matplotlib.
* How to guide the audience's attention with pre-attentive attributes.
* How to use Matplotlib built-in styles — with a case study on the FiveThirtyEight style.
